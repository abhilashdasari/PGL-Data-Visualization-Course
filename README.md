# PGL-Data-Visualization-Course

This is the repository that holds necessary code and documentation required to learn data visualization inside and outside R environment. You should also familiarize yourself with the basics of R/Rstudio from the [following lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQe3Z7hRG1s) or my personal favourite DataCamp videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzXsjmhG_VI&list=PLFOq4OXbrQTB7Am7YBDBw02wtfuSRQGwN) (but this doesn't contain the Rstudio as they code in their own webbased Rstudio like environment).

# Prepare R environment
Kindly install the following packages first. If you don't have R or R-Studio download it from here: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/

```r
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("BiocManager",repos='http://cran.us.r-project.org',dependencies = TRUE)

## Install Biocmanager packages
if (!suppressMessages(require("Biostrings", quietly = TRUE,warn.conflicts = FALSE))) BiocManager::install(c('Biostrings',"S4Vectors","ggtree"))

## Install CRAN packages
packages <- c('dplyr',"BiocManager",'stringr','pacman','tidyr','ggplot2','R3port','ggpubr','plotly','data.table','argparse','ggsci','htmlwidgets','egg',
'remotes','ggplot2',"ggvenn","ggVennDiagram","grafify","esquisse","ggeasy","shinythemes","devtools")
install.packages(setdiff(packages, rownames(installed.packages())), repos='http://cran.us.r-project.org',dependencies = TRUE)


devtools::install_github("majkamichal/easyPlot")
devtools::install_github("gertstulp/ggplotgui")
remotes::install_github("giocomai/ganttrify")
remotes::install_github("feddelegrand7/ddplot")
devtools::install_github("alastairrushworth/inspectdf")
remotes::install_gitlab("hrbrmstr/hrbrthemes")
BiocManager::install("ideal")
```

>Note: If you are a MAC OS user, kindly install [Xquartz](https://www.xquartz.org/) and xcode-select --install for the above packages to be installed correctly.

# Data Visualisation Shortcuts (By Rohit Satyam)
### A. Daily purpose Graphs using Online services
In this section, we will discuss about some online servers given below and understand different chart types and decision on which we should use on which kind of data. We will also discuss about the Rstudio, its features and plugins at the end.

- Venn Diagrams using [JVenn](https://jvenn.toulouse.inra.fr/app/index.html) or [venny](https://www.biotools.fr/misc/venny) or [interactivenn](https://www.interactivenn.net/index.html) or [Venn](https://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/) or [others](https://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/index2.0.2.html)
- Heatmap using [morpheus](http://www.heatmapper.ca/ or https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus/)
- Basic Plots usinf [SRPlot](https://www.bioinformatics.com.cn/srplot), [DataTab](https://datatab.net/statistics-calculator/charts and [RawGraphs](https://app.rawgraphs.io/) or [easyPlot](https://github.com/majkamichal/easyPlot)
- Make Sankey plots using [SankeyMatic](https://sankeymatic.com/)  
- UpSet plots using [intervene](https://intervene.shinyapps.io/intervene/) or [upsetr](https://gehlenborglab.shinyapps.io/upsetr/)
- (not included, only for my own reference) Publication-ready NN-architecture schematics.: https://alexlenail.me/NN-SVG/

### B. Daily purpose Graphs using RStudio
We will then discuss some easy to use R package that have been build upon ggplot2 package to make visualization life hassel free. Often the combinations of 2 or more of these packages are used by us to make plots for your paper. So I have chose these easy ones.

- GGPlot GUI:  https://github.com/gertstulp/ggplotgui
- easyPlot: https://github.com/majkamichal/easyPlot

- esquisse: https://dreamrs.github.io/esquisse/ 
- ggeasy: https://jonocarroll.github.io/ggeasy/
- Hrbrthemes: https://github.com/hrbrmstr/hrbrthemes
- ggtree (Brief introduction): https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/ggtree/inst/doc/ggtree.html
- Cowplot and ggsave: to save high quality images: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cowplot/vignettes/introduction.html

>Note for gantt chart the example data is present [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A_sRyEks7z1DjQW1G6dCIrSgX7U9mZ4sOxcl--iVLFE/edit?usp=sharing) and instead of using R package we will use it's web interface [here](https://ganttrify.europeandatajournalism.eu/) We will also discuss briefly about markdown and Rmarkdown format if time allows.

### C. Creating Scientific Diagrams using Bioicons:
Here we will discuss the resources you can use to make scientific diagrams when you are deprieved of platforms such as Biorender. This will be a theoretical presentation on the following sources. With few examples, we will show you hot to perform SVG file manipulation as well and different kind of image formats you should use.

### D. Choice of Colors
Finally we will cover about how to choose proper color palette for visualization in R or using online server and A chrome extension ColorPic Eyedropper whose link is given below.
- ggsci: R package to use Journal specific color palette: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggsci/vignettes/ggsci.html
